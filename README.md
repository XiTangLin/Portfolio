## 2023: R Studio & ArcGIS
### TSX Forecasting
_Personal Project | R Studio_
- Compared various models for predicting stock returns and developed a simple trading algorithm.
### Solar Panel Report (Personal Project | R)
- Explored the various considerations for installing solar panels for main residences and rental properties after hearing about government incentives.
- Forecasted solar panel energy production, energy prices, overall costs, etc., over the average panel lifespan (30 years).
- Determined costs outweighed the benefits despite government subsidies.
### GIS Assignments
_Coursework | ArcGIS & SQL_
- A selection of geographic analysis: a suitability analysis and a routing analysis
## 2021: Coursework with R Studio
### Seoul Bikes Case Study
_Group Coursework | R Studio_
- Collaborated with team members to analyze qualitative data using R Studio.
- Built the main model and assisted with data exploration and model validation.
- Accounted for seasonality and additional factors while modeling rental bike usage.
### Brown Fat Case Study
_Group Coursework | R Studio_
- Worked with team members to write and present a report.
- Led the data exploration and model-building sections.
- Used train-test splits, heatmaps, etc.
