## 2025: Python ML Projects, AWS S3, Jupyter Notebooks, and Databricks
### Red Wine Quality Data Pipeline
_Personal Project | AWS S3, Databricks, & PySpark_
- Set up a Data Pipeline using AWS S3 and Databricks.
- Used PySpark MLlib to build, tune, and evaluate Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees Models.
- Interpreted the Results and Wrote a Project Summary
- Used Databricks' Git Folders and Pushed Updates to GitHub.
### Pandas Mini-Analysis
_Personal Project | Pandas, Mathplotlib, Numpy & Jupyter Notebooks_
- Built a regression model.
- Created a visualization of the data using matplotlib.
### Women's Budget Text Analysis Paper
_Group Coursework | R Studio, Quanteda, & Hunspell_
- Wrote code for the tokenization and data processing section.
- Coordinated the group to write a paper and complete a presentation.

## 2023: R Programming and Geospatial Analysis
### TSX Forecasting and Trading Algorithm
_Personal Project | R Studio_
- Compared various models for predicting stock returns and developed a simple trading algorithm.
### Solar Panel Profitability Analysis
_Personal Project | R_
- Explored the various considerations for installing solar panels for main residences and rental properties after hearing about government incentives.
- Forecasted solar panel energy production, energy prices, overall costs, etc., over the average panel lifespan (30 years).
- Determined costs outweighed the benefits despite government subsidies.
### GIS Assignments
_Coursework | ArcGIS & SQL_
- A selection of geographic analysis: a suitability analysis and a routing analysis

## 2021: Undergraduate Coursework using R Studio
### Seoul Bikes Case Study
_Group Coursework | R Studio_
- Collaborated with team members to analyze qualitative data using R Studio.
- Built the main model and assisted with data exploration and model validation.
- Accounted for seasonality and additional factors while modeling rental bike usage.
### Brown Fat Case Study
_Group Coursework | R Studio_
- Worked with team members to write and present a report.
- Led the data exploration and model-building sections.
- Used train-test splits, heatmaps, etc.
